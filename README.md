## Description:
I created a simple Blackjack game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features an interactive interface where the player can draw cards ("Hit") or stick with their current hand ("Stay") while aiming to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. The dealer follows traditional Blackjack rules, drawing cards until reaching at least 17. Here are the basic rules of the game.

## Rules:
Card Values:
- Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.
- Face cards (King, Queen, Jack) are worth 10 points.
- Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points, depending on which is more advantageous.

Setup:
- Two cards are dealt to the "player" and the "dealer." Both hands aim to get as close to 21 as possible.
- The dealer reveals one card face-up, while the other remains face-down.

Actions:
- The player chooses to:
  - Hit: Take another card to increase the hand value.
  - Stand: Keep the current hand and end the turn.
- The dealer plays after the player. The dealer must draw cards until their hand is at least 17.

Outcome:
- The hand closest to 21 without exceeding it wins.
- A hand value over 21 is a "bust" and automatically loses.
- A hand totaling exactly 21 with the first two cards is a "blackjack" and beats all other hands.
