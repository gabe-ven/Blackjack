## How to Play

- **Objective:** Get a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer without going over (busting).
- You start with two cards, and so does the dealer.
- One of the dealer’s cards is visible; the other remains hidden until the dealer’s turn.
- You can choose to:
  - **Hit:** Draw another card to improve your hand.
  - **Stand:** Keep your current hand and end your turn.
- After you stand, the dealer draws cards until reaching a minimum hand value of 17.
- The game then determines the winner based on who has the higher valid hand.

## Rules & Card Values

- **Number cards (2-10):** Worth their face value.
- **Face cards (King, Queen, Jack):** Worth 10 points.
- **Aces:** Can count as either 1 or 11 points, whichever benefits the hand more.

- **Bust:** Exceeding 21 points results in an automatic loss.
- **Blackjack:** A two-card hand totaling exactly 21 beats all other hands.
